# SFML-Portfolio
Welcome to my SFML portfolio, a demonstration of my proficiency in C++ using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) for graphics programming. This collection of projects highlights my skills in creating interactive and visually appealing applications.

**Green Circle**

This project features a simple green circle, demonstrating my ability to set up an SFML window and draw shapes with precise control over their properties.

**Bouncing Ball**

A ball that bounces around the window, reacting to collisions with the edges. This project illustrates my understanding of motion, collision detection, and response.

**Interactive 2D Array**

A 2D array of squares that change color dynamically based on user interaction. This project showcases my skills in handling arrays, user input, and real-time graphical updates.

**Phaser**

An animated character that moves in different directions based on user input. This project demonstrates my expertise in sprite animation, texture management, and responsive controls.

**Final Game: 2048**

A remake of the famous 2048 game, featuring a fully functional grid system, tile merging mechanics, and a smooth user interface. This project combines complex logic and game rules to create a polished final product.
